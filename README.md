# RiffWizard - A Customizable Song Recommender for Music Nerds!

The modern music streaming ecosystem contains plenty of reccomender systems that help users find new music, in the form of suggested artists, daily rccomendations, AI-generated playlists, etc. However, very few of them allow for direct control over what what is reccomended to them. This can be annoying for music officionados who know exactly what they want to listen to, and want hyper-personalized reccomendations: For example, Swedish Blackened Death metal released from 1985 to 1990.

Unlike other algorithms, RiffWizard asks for your explicit input first. It uses this input to 'populate' its dataset with a wide array of songs you might like. Then, it begins reccomending you songs, asking for your feedback each time to fine-tune to your tastes. 

**Disclaimer:** This is intended as a personal project for me to learn about Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, API operations, Music Information Retrieval (MIR), and front-end app development, and is not being routinely maintaned.

This project is still in early stages, so stay tuned for more!
