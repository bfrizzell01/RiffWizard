## RiffWizard – A Customizable Song Recommender for Music Enthusiasts

The modern music streaming ecosystem is filled with recommendation systems —suggested artists, daily playlists, AI-generated mixes— but very few allow users to directly control what is recommended. This can be frustrating for music aficionados who know exactly what they want to listen to and crave hyper-personalized recommendations. For example, someone (like me!) might want **ONLY** Swedish Blackened Death Metal released between 1985 and 1990.

RiffWizard takes a different approach. Instead of making assumptions, it asks for your explicit input first. Using this input, it populates a dataset of songs tailored to your preferences. From there, it recommends tracks and actively incorporates your feedback to continuously refine its suggestions to match your unique taste.

RiffWizard is still in the early stages of development, so stay tuned for future updates!
